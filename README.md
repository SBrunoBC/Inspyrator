# Inspyrator
A program to build music scales from the 12-note chromatic scale.
**Python** version only. Plans to fork to other languages, in the process of a HTML5/CSS3/Javascript version.

Currently builds and displays the seven modes of the major scale from a user chosen key.  
The seven modes are:  
___Ionian (Major), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian (minor), Locrian___

Only uses sharps (**#**), no flats (___b___)

Status:  
  Prototype  
  Terminal program only.
